# Speed Ink

Fastest way to write ink smart contract code using AI.

It is a developer tool, that uses fine-tuned generative AI model to write ink smart contract code based on 2 inputs:
- **Intent**: What does user wants to accomplish via contract?
- **Pseudo Code**: A basic english language structure for contract funtions.

The aim of the project, is to help developers accelerate in building ink smart contracts without learning fully into syntax & framework. 

This helps devs & users with:
- Writing contracts for smaller usescases faster
- Experimenting different usescases of smart contracts on substrate
- Non-devs to also write smart contracts for their basic usecase like staking, terms & conditions, agreeement, etc.
